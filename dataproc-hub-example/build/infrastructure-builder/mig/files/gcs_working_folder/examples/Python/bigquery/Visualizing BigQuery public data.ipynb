Behind the scenes, `%%bigquery` uses the BigQuery Python client library to run the given query, convert the results to a pandas `Dataframe`, optionally save the results to a variable, and finally display the results. Using the BigQuery Python client library directly instead of through magic commands gives you more control over your queries and allows for more complex configurations. The library's integrations with pandas enable you to combine the power of declarative SQL with imperative code (Python) to perform interesting data analysis, visualization, and transformation tasks.\n",
